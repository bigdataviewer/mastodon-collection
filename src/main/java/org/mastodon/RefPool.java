 * A pool of objects (usually reusable {@link Ref} objects). It provides methods

 * Implemented in {@link Pool}.</li>
 * <li>A mapping between Java objects and IDs that are assigned upon first
 * access. In this case, {@link #createRef()} and {@link #releaseRef(Object)}
 * simply return {@code null} and do nothing, respectively (see
 * {@link HashBimap}).</li>
